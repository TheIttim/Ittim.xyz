              TycoonMogul is a Discord bot I created with the help of a friend. It was inspired by
              bots like JobsBot(which is now offline), and IdleRPG. The premise of TycoonMogul is
              just like any other Tycoon game; create a tycoon, wait for it to earn money, then use
              that money to upgrade said Tycoon. After you start your path to success, you can even
              go as far as to create an alliance with other Tycoon owners, or even marry that
              special someone. Oh, and there's achievements to be earned along the way! Below you'll
              find two tables. One listing every command, and the other listing every achievement.
              Still not convinced? Well, what if I told you TycoonMogul is a{" "}

              bot, which means that it is trusted by Discord itself to never misuse the small amount
              of data that it captures! On top of that, we are working to become certified on bot
              lists that TycoonMogul is on that have such a feature. So far, TycoonMogul is in 8
              lists, with 7 websites, with 5 certification programs, and is certified in 1 of them.
              Now while this may not sound like a lot, well, that's because it isn't; but don't
              fret! We've put a hold on our applications until version 2 of TycoonMogul comes out,
              as most certification programs require us to update our code in order to share our
              server count with their website, and simply don't see any point in doing so until we
              release version 2, but when that time comes, rest assured, we will push our server
              count to all lists in an effort to be more transparent and increase our certification
              chances, thereby increasing said server count! With that addition, we will also be
              support vote rewards from as many of the lists as possible!{" "}
