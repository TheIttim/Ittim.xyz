    <h1>Mogul Development</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>Mogul Development is my development team, which updates and maintains projects such as TycoonMogul, and
        <a href="https://moguldevs.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MogulDevs.xyz</a>, and is also the focus of the
        Discord server located in the footer. I started the team alongside 2
        of my good friends, who play vitals roles; Puyodead1 as the Lead, and really only Developer, and XiuhcoatlSlayer
        as the Lead
        Moderator. TycoonMogul is a Discord economy bot, and the flagship project, as it was the whole reason we created
        the team. It brings entertainment to an ever increasing number of servers, as you can see by the counter in the
        top-right, which is always updating via our TM-API. <a href="https://moguldevs.xyz/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">MogulDevs.xyz</a> is our website to show off everything, so if you want to learn more in
        detail, you should head over there. Otherwise, feel free to invite <a
            href="https://top.gg/bot/519954424270028811" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TycoonMogul</a> to your servers,
        and try it out, we'll appreciate it bunches!
