    <p>As the heading states, my name is Ethan. I enjoy learning & volunteering, thus I have plenty of certifications as
        well as volunteer hours. I currently attend <a href="https://www.bpcc.edu" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">Bossier Parish Community College</a> as a Computer Information Systems Major, while also
        serving as both the Student Government & Rotaract President. I have already graduated with CTCs in Help
        Desk, Computer Repair, & Network Security, and have also earned many certifications, but I'll list those
        elsewhere. Oh, I am also always on Discord, and have begun streaming from time to time, and to top it off, I
        coded about 98% of this website, with minor help from a friend!
        <br><br>
        As for work, I am actually a part-time employee at BPCC, and have been so for just over 1 year. My first
        position was as a Student Worker in Student Life, which was then followed by working in the BPCC Prometric Test
        Center onthe other side of campus as a regular part-time employee, meaning my pay almost doubled. Now, as of
        10/12/2020, I am in the process of transferring to the Cavalier Care Center, where I will still be part time,
        but I will be doing what I love, helping students, while also furthering my education.
